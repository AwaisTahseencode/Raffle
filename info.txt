we are making the address payable cuz we have to pay the winner once the random picker is available
Now when we push the msg.sender into the array we should also make it payable otherwise it ll not work
so typeCast it before entering the array
--------------------------------------------------------
Events: When we want to update the dynamic array or object we have to emit the event

Events allows us to "print" this information into a log instead of savinf it into the gas consuming 
storage variable
-----------
logs live in such dataStructure so smart contracts cant excess it thats y they are gas efficient
=======================
when we emit the event there are 2 types of params 
1)Indexed params
2)NonIndexed params
Indexed params are also called topics
we can have maximum 3 indexed params 
------------------------------
Index params are much easier to search for and much easier for query
NI are hard to search cuz they have abi encoded and its hard to decode them
=======================================
Data is encoded abi version/data but if you have the abi its very easy to decode the data
NI variables costs less gas 
--------------------------
keyhash is the hash that determines the gas limit of our requested random number
======================================
ChainLink VRF is 2 process transactionNetwork
====================================
VRFV2 constructor params is the address of the contract which does our random number confirmation
===================================================
If we want to trigger the contract automatically after sometime with smsort of params or timeInterval we use 
ChainLink keepers to achieve automaticity 
======================
To use keepers we have to do the 2 steps 
1)Verify with 2 methods that contract are compatible 
2)We have to register the contract with upkeep for the chainLink keeper network
===================
Mostly ofchain computation happens in checkUpKeep,this runs offline by a node of chainLink keeper network
